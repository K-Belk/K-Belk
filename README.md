Military Veteran and Controls Technician of 5 years, turned Software Engineer. Expertise in programming new high speed stamping presses and integrating accessory equipment into automated processes to produce parts in excess of 2000 parts per minute with minimal human interaction. Passion for coding began in college, building small robots and various other projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and has only grown since.
